# Minecraft-Forge-Mods
Mods created for forgemodloader that I use for our friend group. Most are made because old mods are not updated to 1.16.1, and I wanted to create them myself as an exercise.

LightCycleMod (MC 1.16.1)
    Allows an operator to change the length of the full day cycle in terms of real minutes.
    To build this you need to setup the forgemodloader MDK and use gradle to build the jar.
    To directly download this mod, go to builds and download the most recent jar. Requires forge version 46 for MC 1.16.1 or newer.
